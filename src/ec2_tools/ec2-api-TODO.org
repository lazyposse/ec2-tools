* DONE Make the api work

The problems were multiple:
- bad signature
- no signature really (oops!)
- duplicated entry in the fiels to sign
- missing /
* DONE Externalize credentials (oops again!)

* DONE Try another function (describe a region for example)
CLOSED: [2012-10-01 lun. 19:59]
* DONE Use the xml as the accept flux

* DONE Extract the namespace into a separate project
CLOSED: [2012-10-02 mar. 18:52]
* DONE Explain how to setup the project
CLOSED: [2012-10-02 mar. 19:00]
* DONE Split the multiple functions into namespaces
CLOSED: [2012-10-02 mar. 19:16]
* DONE More detailled example on the README + the output part.

* DONE Function to list instances
CLOSED: [2012-10-02 mar. 20:52]
* DONE Improve the input of the query-amazon (as a map instead of a string for example)
CLOSED: [2012-10-02 mar. 21:27]
Thus we do not limit the existing possibility of the amazon api.
